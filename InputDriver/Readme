[Build]
Generally you don't have to modify key layout files. Buu, if you want to make some change, you should build them and put them at the project folder so that Remoteroid can apply new keyboard layouts. 

To build new kcm.bin from remoteroid_below_3.0.kcm, simply type 'make all' on console. It will build kcm tool, then will convert remoteroid_below_3.0.kcm into remoteroid_kb.kcm.bin. Since Android 3.0, it uses *.kcm(But its grammar is different from older one), you don't have to build *.kcm.bin if you are planning to support Android 2.3 or lower.

When all process completed, simply move following files into Remoteroid project's /res/raw directory.

- remoteroid_idc.idc
- remoteroid_kcm.kcm
- remoteroid_kb.kcm.bin
- remoteroid_kl.kl
